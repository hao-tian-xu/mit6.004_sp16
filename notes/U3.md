# <u>L16-17: Pipelining the Beta</u>

## Pipeline Hazards

- not combinational
	- Beta has state: PC, Register file, Memories 
	- There are dependencies we cannot break!
		- To compute the next PC
		- To write result into the register file 
- Plan of attack
	1. Design a 5-stage pipeline that works with sequences of independent instructions
	2. Handle data hazards
	3. Handle control hazards
- Resolving Hazards
	1. **Stall**. Wait for the result to be available by freezing earlier pipeline stages 
	2. **Bypass**. Route data to the earlier pipeline stage as soon as it is calculated 
	3. **Speculate**
		- Guess a value and continue executing anyway 
		- When actual value is available, two cases 
			- Guessed correctly: do nothing
			- Guessed incorrectly: kill & restart with correct value

## a 5-stage pipeline

- Pipeline registers separate different stages: 
	- IF - instruction fetch
	- RF - register file access
	- ALU - compute result
	- MEM - memory access
	- WB - write back to reg. file

## Data Hazards

- Example

  - ```assembly
  	ADDC(R1, 1, R2)	
  	SUBC(R2, 4, R3)	
  	MUL(R6, R7, R8)	
  	XOR(R9, R10, R11)	
  	```

  	- ​	<img src="image.assets/Screen Shot 2021-09-15 at 19.50.58.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-15 at 19.50.58" style="zoom:33%;" />
  	

- Stall

	-  ​	<img src="image.assets/Screen Shot 2021-09-16 at 09.11.55.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-16 at 09.11.55" style="zoom: 25%;" />

- Bypass

	-  ​	<img src="image.assets/Screen Shot 2021-09-16 at 09.12.42.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-16 at 09.12.42" style="zoom:25%;" />
	-  Load-To-Use Stalls 
		- Bypassing cannot eliminate load delays because data is not available until the WB stage! 

### Compiler Resolution

- Compilers can rearrange code to put dependent instructions farther away
- Example: <img src="image.assets/Screen Shot 2021-09-16 at 09.14.39.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-16 at 09.14.39" style="zoom:33%;" />
- Only works well when compiler can find independent instructions to move around! 



## Control Hazards

- Stall
- Speculate

### Exception

++ exception BNE 在之后的pipeline stage里加载？



## 5-Stage Beta: Final Version

<img src="image.assets/Screen Shot 2021-09-16 at 09.23.42.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-16 at 09.23.42" style="zoom: 50%;" />

- Data hazards: 
	- Stall IF and RF (STALL=1 + IRSrc^RF^=NOP) 
	- Bypass
- Control hazards: Speculate PC+4 and
	- JMP or taken branch in RF
		- IRSrc^IF^=NOP 
		- PCSEL $\to$ JT/branch target 
	- If exception at stage X 
		- IRSrc^X^=BNE
		- Previous IRSrc^X^=NOP 
		- PCSEL $\to$ XAdr or IllOp 
	- If interrupt 
		- IRSrc^IF^=BNE 
		- PCSEL $\to$ XAdr

## Limits to Pipeline Depth



- Tradeoffs
	- Advantages
		- higher clock frequency
	- Cost
		- More bypass paths & control logic
	- Disadvantages
		- More overlapping
		- Clock overhead becomes increasingly 

## *Thinking*

- These two lectures introduce pipelining the Beta. The previously described contouring method can only cope with circuits that conform to static discipline after simplification. However, the actual CPU contains states (PC, Register, Memory) that are not combinational and therefore create synchronization problems:
  - The data needed to perform a step (register, branch0 or 1...) has not yet arrived
    - Stall, which suspends the step until the required data arrives
    - Bypass, where data that has already been calculated (usually ALU) but has not yet arrived at its destination (register) is used directly
      - Costly complex mux, heavily wired
    - Speculate, usually used in control commands, such as loop usually guessing branch, also based on the last decision



- 这两讲介绍了将Beta流水线化，之前介绍的contouring的方法只能应对简化后符合static discipline的电路，但实际的CPU包含state（PC，Register，Memory），不是combinational的，因此会产生同步问题：
  - 进行一个步骤时需要的数据（register，branch0或1……）还未到达
    - 暂停stall，暂停该步骤直到需要的数据到达
    - 搭桥bypass，将已经计算好（通常为ALU）但还未到达目的地（register）的数据直接使用
      - 成本复杂的mux，大量接线
    - 推测speculate，通常在控制命令中使用，如loop通常猜测branch，也可以根据上次的决定



# <u>L18: Virtual Memory</u>

### Extending the Memory Hierarchy

-  ​	<img src="image.assets/Screen Shot 2021-09-19 at 14.19.14.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-19 at 14.19.14" style="zoom:33%;" />
- Problem: DRAM vs disk has much mlore extreme differences than SRAM vs DRAM
	- Access latencies
		- DRAM ~10-100x slower than SRAM
		- Disk ~100,000x slower than DRAM
	- Importance of sequential accesses:
		- DRAM: Fetching successive words ~5x faster than first word
		- Disk: Fetching successive words ~100,000x faster than first word
- Result: Design decisions driven by enormous cost of misses

### Impact of Enormous Miss Penalty

- If DRAM was to be organized like an SRAM cache, how should we design it?
	- Associativity: High, minimize miss ratio
	- Block size: Large, amortize cost of a miss over multiple words (locality)
	- Write policy: Write back, minimize number of writes
- Is there anything good about misses being so expensive?
	- We can handle them in software! What's 1000 extra instructions ( 1us) vs $10 \mathrm{~ms}$ ?
	- Approach: Handle hits in hardware, misses in software
		- Simpler implementation, more flexibility

## Basics of Virtual Memory

### Memory management unit (MMU)

-    ​	<img src="image.assets/Screen Shot 2021-09-19 at 14.21.45.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-19 at 14.21.45" style="zoom:33%;" />

### Paging

-    ​	<img src="image.assets/Screen Shot 2021-09-19 at 14.23.30.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-19 at 14.23.30" style="zoom:33%;" />
- Divide physical memory in fixed-size blocks, called pages
	- Typical page size (2p): 4KB -16 KB
	- Virtual address: Virtual page number + offset bits
	- Physical address: Physical page number + offset bits
- MMU maps virtual pages to physical pages
	- Use page map to perform translation
	- Cause a page fault (a miss) if virtual page is not resident in physical memory.

### Simple Page Map Design

-    ​	<img src="image.assets/Screen Shot 2021-09-19 at 14.24.16.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-19 at 14.24.16" style="zoom:33%;" />
- Resident bit R = 1 for pages stored in RAM
- Dirty bit D = 1 if we’ve changed this page since loading it from disk

### Page Faults

- If a page does not have a valid translation, MMU causes a page fault. OS page fault handler is invoked, handles miss
	- Choose a page to replace, write it back if dirty. Mark page as no longer resident
	- Read page from secondary storage into available physical page
	- Update page map to show new page is resident
	- Return control to program, which re-executes memory access

## Building the MMU

### RAM-Resident Page Maps

- Small page maps can use dedicated SRAM… gets expensive for big ones! 
- Solution: Move page map to main memory:

### Cache: Translation Look-aside Buffer (TLB)

- Problem: 2x performance hit… each memory reference now takes 2 accesses!
- Solution: Cache the page map entries
  - ​	<img src="image.assets/Screen Shot 2021-09-19 at 14.27.22.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-19 at 14.27.22" style="zoom:33%;" />




## Contexts

### A Sneak Preview

1. TIMESHARING among several programs
	- Separate context for each program
	- OS loads appropriate context into page map when switching among programs
2. Separate context for OS "Kernel" (e.g., interrupt handlers)...
	- “Kernel" vs "User" contexts
	- Switch to Kernel context on interrupt;
	- Switch back on interrupt return.



## MMU Improvements

### Multi-level Page Maps

### Rapid Context-Switching

-    ​	<img src="image.assets/Screen Shot 2021-09-19 at 14.29.44.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-19 at 14.29.44" style="zoom:33%;" />
- Add a register to hold index of current context. To switch contexts: update Context # and PageTblPtr registers. Don’t have to flush TLB since each entry’s tag includes context # in addition to virtual page number

### Using Caches with Virtual Memory

- Physically-Indexed, Virtually-Tagged Cache
	- Cache index comes entirely from address bits in page offset – don’t need to wait for MMU to start cache lookup!
	  - ​	<img src="image.assets/Screen Shot 2021-09-19 at 14.37.53.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-19 at 14.37.53" style="zoom:33%;" />

## *Thinking*

- End-to-end Core i7 Address Translation (from 15-213)
	-    ​	<img src="image.assets/image-20210919141731271.png" alt="image-20210919141731271" style="zoom: 33%;" />
- The content largely overlaps the part of 15-213. The most important concept is the use of virtual memory to make the memory as a cache of the hard disk (and thus support multi-process)



- 内容和15-213的基本重叠，最重要的概念依然是使用virtual memory使得内存作为硬盘的缓存（并以此支持多进程）

# <u>L19: Virtual Machines</u>

## Processes

### Building a Virtual Machine (VM)

- Goal: give each program its own “VIRTUAL MACHINE”
- New abstraction: a process which has its own
	-  machine state: R0, …, R30
	- context (virtual address space)
	- PC, stack
	- program (w/ shared code)
	- virtual I/O devices
- “OS Kernel” is a special, privileged process running in its own context. 
	- It manages the execution of other processes and handles real I/O devices, emulating virtual I/O devices for each process.

### One VM For Each Process

- Abstraction
	- CPU, Virtual Memory, Windows, I/O events, files, sockets, SVCs...

### Processes: Multiplexing the CPU

1. Running in process #0
2. Stop execution of process #0 either because of explicit yield or some sort of timer interrupt; trap to handler code, saving current PC+4 in XP
3. First: save process #0 state (regs, context) Then: load process #1 state (regs, context)
4. "Return" to process #1: just like return from other trap handlers (ie., use address in XP ) but we're returning from a different trap than happened in step 2!
5. Running in process #1

## Timesharing

### OS Organization: Processes

-    ​	<img src="image.assets/Screen Shot 2021-09-19 at 17.06.57.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-19 at 17.06.57" style="zoom:25%;" />

### Key Technology: Timer Interrupts

-    ​	<img src="image.assets/Screen Shot 2021-09-19 at 17.02.44.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-19 at 17.02.44" style="zoom: 25%;" />

### Beta Interrupt Handling

- Minimal Hardware Implementation:
	- Check for Interrupt Requests (IRQs) before each instruction fetch.
	- On IRQ j:
		- copy PC+4 into Reg[XP];
		- INSTALL j*4 as new PC.
- Handler Coding:
	- Save state in "UserMState" structure
	- Call C procedure to handle the exception
	- re-install saved state from UserMState
	- Return to Reg[XP]-4
- WHERE to find handlers?
	- BETA Scheme: WIRE IN a low-memory address for each exception handler entry point
	- Common alternative: WIRE IN the address of a TABLE of handler addresses (“interrupt vectors”)

## Supervisor Calls

### Communicating with the OS

- Abstraction: a supervisor call (SVC) with args in registers – result in R0 or maybe user-mode memory
- Beta Implementation: use illegal instructions to cause an exception -- OS code will recognize these particular illegal instructions as a user-mode SVCs

### OS Organization: Supervisor Calls

-    ​	<img src="image.assets/Screen Shot 2021-09-19 at 17.08.25.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-19 at 17.08.25" style="zoom:25%;" />



## *Thinking*

- Processes, time-sharing, and supervisor calls are introduced. All are implemented through the kernel of the operating system.



- 介绍了进程（process）、分时系统（time sharing）和管理程序调用（supervisor call）。都通过操作系统的内核（kernel）来完成。



# <u>L20: SVCs, Devices, and Interrupts</u>

## OS Device Handlers

### OS Organization: I/O Devices

-  ​	<img src="image.assets/Screen Shot 2021-09-20 at 09.58.44.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-20 at 09.58.44" style="zoom:25%;" />



## SVCs for Input/Output

### ReadKey SVC

- Attempt 1

	- ```c
		ReadKey_h()
		{
		  int kbdnum = ProcTbl[Cur].DPYNum;
		  while (BufferEmpty(kbdnum)) {
		    /* busy wait loop */
		  }
		  UserMState.Regs[0] = ReadInputBuffer(kbdnum);
		}
		```

	- Problem: Can’t interrupt code running in the supervisor mode… so the buffer never gets filled.

- Attempt 2

	- ```c
		...
			if (BufferEmpty(kbdnum)) {
		    /* busy wait loop */
		    UserMState.Regs[XP] = UserMState.Regs[XP]-4;
		  }
		...
		```

	- Problem: The process just wastes its time-slice waiting for someone to hit a key...

- Attempt 3

	- ```c
		...
		  if (BufferEmpty(kbdnum)) {
		    UserMState.Regs[XP] = UserMState.Regs[XP]-4;
		    Scheduler( );
		  }
		...
		```

	- RESULT: Better CPU utilization!!

- Attempt 4

	- UNIX kernel utilities: 
		- sleep(reason) - Puts CurProc to sleep. “Reason” is an arbitrary binary value giving a condition for reactivation. 
		- wakeup(reason) - Makes active any process in sleep(reason).

## Real Time

- The Need for “Real Time”
	- Difficult to meet “hard deadlines” 
		- control applications, e.g., ESC on cars 
		- playing videos/MP3s

- Interrupt Latency
	-  ​	<img src="image.assets/Screen Shot 2021-09-20 at 11.17.34.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-20 at 11.17.34" style="zoom:33%;" />

### Weak Priorities

- Latencies with WEAK PRIORITIES: Service of each device might be delayed by: 
	- Service of 1 other (arbitrary) device, whose interrupt request was just honored; + 
	- Service of ALL higher-priority devices.

### Strong Priorities

- STRONG PRIORITY ORDERING: Allow handlers for LOWER PRIORITY interrupts to be preempted (interrupted) by HIGHER PRIORITY requests



## *Thinking*

- This lecture continues from the previous talk, introducing how user programs access I/O devices through SVC.
- Then, it introduces other multitasking methods outside the time-sharing system to cope with real-time: weak priority and strong priority (Preemption).



- 本讲继续上一讲，介绍了使用者程序（user）通过SVC访问I/O设备的方式。
- 然后介绍了分时系统外的其他多任务处理方式来应对实时（real time）：弱优先级和强优先级（Preemption 抢占式多任务处理）。

# <u>Lab9. Emulating Instructions</u>

## *Thinking*

- This lab describes how to write new instructions for Beta through the mechanism of "illegal instruction."
  - The format of the command is determined by macro, e.g.
    - `.macro LDB(RA,CC,RC) betaopc(0x10,RA,CC,RC)`
  - Since the opcode does not exist, the illegal instruction mechanism is triggered.
    - The circuit in Beta sets the value of the program counter to 0x4
    - checkoff sets the command at 0x4 to `BR(UI)`, thus jumping to the symbolic UI address
    - Store PC+4 in XP
  - Read the binary machine code of the illegal command in the UI via XP-4 to get the required information.
    - illegal opcode, registers, literal
    - There are some particular ways to handle these data, such as extract_field, handwritten sign_extension, handling of literal stored in registers, reading and writing data from the original regs as arrays in memory, etc. (see code for details)
  - ++ Because of the need to read much memory, this way should not be as convenient as macros come



- 这个lab介绍了如何通过“illegal instruction”的机制来为Beta编写新的instruction：
  - 通过macro决定命令的格式，如
    - `.macro LDB(RA,CC,RC)	betaopc(0x10,RA,CC,RC)`
  - 由于opcode不存在，因此触发illegal instruction机制：
    - Beta中电路将program counter的值设置为0x4
    - checkoff中将0x4处命令设为`BR(UI)`，从而跳转到符号UI的地址
    - 将PC+4存储在XP中
  - 在UI中通过XP-4读取非法命令的二进制机器码，从而获取所需信息：
    - illegal opcode，registers，literal
    - 对这些数据的处理有些特别的方式，如extract_field，手写sign_extension，存储在reg中的literal的处理，将原有regs的数据作为内存中的array来读写等（详见代码）
  - ++ 由于需要大量对内存进行读取，这种方式应该不如macros来得方便



# <u>Lab10. Tiny Operating System</u>

## *Thinking*

- This lab describes the use of UASM (microassembler) to implement a simple time-sharing operating system.
- The code initially contains the kernel process and two user processes. The focus is on how to coordinate between different processes.
  - The Process Table stores the base and bounds of each process decided at assembly time. The kernel starts with the first process in ProbTbl: store XP, SEG_BASE, SEG_BOUNDS, and jump to XP.
  - Process 0 is to read the keyboard input and then output the converted Pig Latin in the console. Both keyboard reading and output need to use kernel.



- 这个lab介绍了使用UASM（microassembler）来实现一个简单的分时系统（time sharing）的操作系统。
- 代码中本来包含kernal process和两个user process，重点是如何在不同的process之间协调。
  - Process Table中保存了在assembly时决定的各process的base和bounds，kernel开始时先从ProbTbl中的第一个Process开始：存储XP，SEG_BASE，SEG_BOUNDS，跳转到XP
  - Process 0的功能是读取键盘输入，然后将转换后的pig latin输出在console中，键盘读取和输出都需要使用kernel
