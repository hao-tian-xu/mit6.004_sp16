## Computation Structure

This repository shares the learning process of the course 6.004 with online materials from MIT OCW. The results are divided into the following three parts:

1. Lecture and lab notes, each with a summary titled *Thinking*, in Markdown
   - Including a final review (only in Chinese now).
2. Labs' solutions
   - Complete solutions are stored in `saved_state.json` files under each folder, which can be restored on [this site](https://computationstructures.org/exercises/cmos/lab.html)
   - For convenience, circuit designs are also saved as screenshots, and other solutions are saved as text files.
3. Quizzes' solutions
